### Welcomme to Polluterito

An app which is just a person's solution to know the Pollution stats of his country.

This app aims at making Pollution tracking easy. It helps people to track the data of their country at the time. Although right now the app only supports a few countries. 
The countries are :- 
 - India
 - USA
 - UK
 - Russia
 - Turkey
 - Finland
 - Switzerland
 - Japan
 - China

## How is this app related to the theme ? 
The app is just a buddy of the theme. How ? So here it is. This app provides you the users the data of Pollution and then you can use it to check the Pollution stats and also if you feel the Pollution is too high then you may start thinking what to do. (Psst.... Dont tell anyone that our trick to reduce pollution is related to Human Pyschology. We think that people will feel bad seeing the bad pollution stats and rest you know.)

## How to download ? 

Ah ! That is a nice question mate ! So this app is only for Android Devices (Sorry iOS users we dont have Macs). So in the releases section of this GitHub Repository you can download the .apk file. 

For Android Devices -> https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-install-apk-on-android
For emulators -> Just drag and drop the .apk file on the Emulator. Google made the Emulator smart enough to download itself.
